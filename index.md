excerpt: "I am currently a research scientist and UI intelligence team lead at CSIRO's Data61, and the first TUM-IAS Dieter Schwarz fellow from 2024-2027. Before joining Data61, I pursued my Ph.D. degree in computer science at Australian National University. My work lies in the fields of software engineering, deep learning, and human computer interaction. My main research topics are around **human-centred software engineering**, **software usability** and **UI engineering**. My long-term goal is to create intelligent software that co-evolves with people—understanding human intent, supporting collaboration, and ensuring transparency and trust.
Specifically, through UI engineering, my work aims to (1) advance human–AI collaboration through mutual intent clarification and adaptive understanding in software GUI design generation; (2) democratise the use of complex and intelligent software and AI regardless of expertise and ability; and (3) govern manipulative behaviours in digital interfaces.

Jieshan is currently a **research scientist** and **UI intelligence team lead** at **CSIRO's Data61**, and the first **TUM-IAS Dieter Schwarz fellow** from 2024-2027. She received her Ph.D. degree in computer science at Australian National University, where she was advised by [Zhenchang Xing](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/zhenchang-xing).

She works at the intersection of **software engineering** and **human–computer interaction**, driven by a passion for solving real-world problems that meaningfully impact people’s everyday lives. Her research focuses on **human-centred software engineering, software usability, and UI engineering**, with the long-term goal of creating intelligent software that co-evolves with people—understanding human intent, supporting collaboration, and ensuring transparency and trust. Specifically, her work aims to: <br />
(1) advance human–AI collaboration through mutual intent clarification and adaptive understanding in GUI design generation (e.g., TOSEM20, TOCHI25, ICSE25); <br />
(2) democratise access to complex and intelligent software systems, making them usable regardless of users’ expertise or ability (e.g., ICSE20, FSE20, CHI22, UIST24, TOSEM23); and <br />
(3) govern manipulative behaviours in digital interfaces to promote fairness and accountability (e.g., UIST23, WWW25).

She currently leads projects on detecting deceptive patterns, advancing UI design search and generation, enhancing mobile application usability and accessibility, and improving the robustness of agentic systems.. Her research outcomes have been integrated into industrial tools adopted by major companies such as Apple and Alibaba, ultimately benefiting billions of end-users worldwide.

Jieshan has published papers at top-tier CORE A*/R1 venues, including ICSE, FSE, ASE, UIST, CHI, TOSEM and TOCHI, and contanstly serves as PC members and reviewers for top-tier conferences and journal. She got one SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ICSE2020. See her [Google Scholar Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=slrzj8kAAAAJ) for more details.
