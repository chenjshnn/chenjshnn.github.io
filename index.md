excerpt: "I am currently a research scientist and UI intelligence team lead at CSIRO's Data61. Before joining Data61, I pursued my Ph.D. degree in computer science at Australian National University. My work lies in the fields of software engineering, deep learning, and human computer interaction. By understanding the semantics of user interfaces (UIs), my work aims to improve designers’, developers’, and end-users’ efficiency when designing, developing and using the mobile applications. I am currently working on android code generation from UI design, UI design search and generation, and mobile application accessibility enhancement."

Jieshan is currently a research scientist and UI intelligence team lead at CSIRO's Data61. She received her Ph.D. degree in computer science at Australian National University, where she was advised by [Zhenchang Xing](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/zhenchang-xing) and [Chunyang Chen](https://chunyang-chen.github.io/). 

She works at the intersection of software engineering and human computer interaction. She is always passionate on addressing real-life problems that can actually impact people's daily life. The main goal of her research is to use human-centred technique to examine and ensure responsible software development by design. She is currently working on dark pattern detection, data visualisation, UI design search and generation, and mobile application accessibility enhancement.

Jieshan has published many papers at top-tier CORE A* ranked conferences/journals, including ICSE, FSE, UIST, CHI, TOSEM and USENIX Security. The ICSE20 paper got the SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award. See her [Google Scholar Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=slrzj8kAAAAJ) for more details.
